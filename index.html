   <ul>
     <li>1916: Born in a hosipital in nearby Petoskey</li>
    <li>1932: Graduated from Gaylord High School. Shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical things.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1932: Shannon entered the University of Michigan</li>
    <br>
    <li>1936: He graduated with two bachelor's degrees: one in electrical engineering and the other in mathematics</li>
    <br>
    <li>1936: Shannon began his graduate studies in electrical engineering at MIT, where he worked on Vannevar Bush's Differential analyzer, Shannon designed switching citcuits based on Boole's concepts.</li>
    <br<
    <li>1937: He wrote his master's degree thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1938: A paper from this thesis was published</li>
    <br>
    <li>1940: Shannon received his PhD from MIT.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1940: Shannon became a National Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced STudy in Princeton, New Jerser. In Princeton, Shannon has the opportunity to dicuss his ideas with  influential scientists and mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl and JOn von Neumann, and he also had occasional encounters with Albert Enstein and Kurt GÃ¶del.</li>
    <br>
    <li> Shannon worked freely across disciplines, and this ability may have contributed to his later development of mathematical information theory.</li>
